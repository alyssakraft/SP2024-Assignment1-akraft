<!--Find a movie or TV series that you are a fan of and employ the following HTML/CSS features:
A background color for the entire page of your choosing.
A div containing:
 an H1 Element with an ID of 'Title'.

 Image element related to the media with and ID of 'CoverArt' (Cover art is good here). This image should be circular/have rounded edges.
 Heading 5 element with an ID of 'Rating'. This should be the rating from IMDB out of 10.
 Iframe embeding a youtube video of a trailer of the media with an ID of 'Trailer'. This can be acquired by right clicking on the video, and copying the embed.
 Attribute linking to the IMDB page.
 the summary text from IMDB in a Paragraph element with an ID of 'Summary'.
 Unordered list of three to five actors. This unorder list element should have an ID of 'Actors'.
All content on the page should be centered.
Color all text on the page in a contrasting color to the one you picked for the background.
It is best to take this little pieces at a time, step by step, as not to get confused by too many things at once. W3 Schools is an amazing resource, and has examples on everything above if you get stuck.
Feel free to get creative and add additional features after base requirements have been met
Publishing the application to Azure
Publishing the app is a key requirement of the assignment. Follow the steps referenced in class and in the corresponding video from class. GitHub will be required for future projects but not this assignment.
